summary: "The Study focuses on three landfill sites of Delhi- Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla. These landfill sites are located in highly populated residential sites, near river Yamuna, waterbodies, eco-sensitives areas of Delhi"
---

Ghazipur Landfill Site- This landfill site is tallest (65 meters) among all the landfills of India and located between waterbodies Yamuna river, Hindon river and Shahadra drain in east Delhi. One lake trilokpuri sanjay lake lies within the buffer zone (see map). Eco-sensitive zones Okhla Bird sanctuary and Kalindi Kunj park also lies near this landfill.

Bhalswa Landfill Site- In north Delhi this landfill site is near Yamuna river, Najafgarh drain, Western Yamuna canal (within buffer), Bhalswa lake (within buffer) and Yamuna biodiversity park an ecosensitive zone also almost falls within the buffer zone. All these waterbodies and eco-sensitive zone are linked to this landfill (see map).

Okhla Landfill Site- In south Delhi this site in between the Yamuna river and Agra Canal both waterbodies lies within buffer zone. Asola Bhati wildlife sanctuary is eco-sensitive zone also lies in buffer of this lanfill closely. Two already discussed eco-sensitive zones; Okhla Bird sanctuary and Kalindi Kunj park (both are important waterbodies too) lies between the two landfill sites Okhla and Ghazipur almost falls within buffer. (see maps)

Groundwater is directly affected due to high pollution load of the landfill leachate and its infiltration in the groundwater. The three landfills are located close to river Yamuna and floodplain area which makes it more susceptible to leaching of toxic chemicals to grounwater.
