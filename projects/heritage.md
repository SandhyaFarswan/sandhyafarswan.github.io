So I collected data on The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) from the Food and Agriculture Oraganization of the United Nations (FAO) and generated map using ArcGIS. Agriculture is most old & traditional support system to human, also very sensitive indicator to climate and environment. Globally 62 GIAHS sites are designated by FAO all around the world to protect food security, unique natural agriculture practices, ethnicity, traditional ecological knowledge and livelihoods. In India 3 GIAHS sites are in Koraput Traditional Agriculture (Odisha), Kuttanad Below Sea Level Farming System (Kerala) and Pampore Saffron Heritage (Jammu & Kashmir).

In addition to my lab work, I attended the AMGEN Symposium at UCLA, gave an oral presentation about my research, and presented a poster at the UC Berkeley AMGEN poster session.
