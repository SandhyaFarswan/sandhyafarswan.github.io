Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) was proposed first in COP11 is a well crafted policy approach to help reduce deforestation in developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). REDD+ contributes to greenhouse gas emission reductions, maintains or enhances forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. From data cllected on Forest Based Carbon Unit Potential of Indian States (Data Source for Carbon Stock, Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation) and analysed that north-east states like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya etc. has most potential. That's why many REDD+ projects are been developed in India like REDD+ project in the PKR (Phenstunyu Khenyupj Rumesinyu) Reserve in Nagaland and community-based REDD+ project in Garo Hills, Meghalaya, focusing on conserving stretches of high biodiversity forestsVegetation Map of India created using ArcGIS and Data Source from The Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL), WWF, India is one of the few countries in the world to have all the type of Vegetations of the world. Tropical Dry Deciduous forests, Tropical Moist Deciduous forest and tropical Semi-evergreen forests in India have maximum carbon stock and they play a major role in climate change mitigation.

India is a huge country with 21% of our geographical area under forest and has potential of generating 7082 million carbon units from its forest. State-wise Carbon Stock in Different Forest Carbon Pools in India in from 2011 to 2017 created from data source: Carbon Stock, Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation. According to IPCC GPG five main carbon pools are aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon (SOC).
