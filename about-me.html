    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>

    <p>I am a geospatial data analyst interested in developing and exploring environmental science through geomatics visualisation.</p>

    <p>Currently, I work in the ENVIS on Geodiversity and Impact on Environment at <a href="http://jnuenvis.nic.in/index.html">School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> as a GIS expert, enabling mandates, information dissemination from spatial/non-spatial, primary/secondary datasets in diverse thematic areas and interdisciplinary work for ENVIS's unique information-based GIS and remote sensing platform. Between 2012-2013, I worked at <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in/sss/csrd">Center for the Study of Regional Development (CSRD)</a>, as Junior Research Fellow on Land use land cover mapping, Change Detection, Watershed analysis done using ArcGIS, Erads Imagine softwares, Field survey and Landsat satellite data, ASTER DEM used to delineate the mapping for Parvati river basin, Himachal Pradesh Study.</p>

    <p>Prior to CSRD, I received a M.Sc in Remote Sensing and GIS Applications from Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in <a href="https://www.hnbgu.ac.in/">School of Earth Science, Department of Remote Sensing and GIS</a>. There I focused on learning cartography, visual/digital interpretation of topographical sheets, forest inventory, classification, satellite datasets, band combination, digitization, layout and mapping etc. I explored field survey work and handling softwares ArcGIS, ArcView and Erdas Imagine</p>

    <p>Much of my initial interest in geospatial science and environment conservation can be credited to my experience as an graduate led to two trainings further, one of which was for 2 months summer training in <a href="https://www.ongcindia.com/">Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd., KDMIPE Campus, RS & Geomatics division, Dehradun</a>! Towards the end of M.Sc degree, I interned at <a href="https://www.iirs.gov.in/">RRSC-N, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing</a> to develop Digital Elevation Model using satellite stereo data for a part of Patna district, Bihar carried out under the SIS-DP project of ISRO using Leica Photogrammetric Suite manager 2011 workstation with Stereo Data Processing and OrthoGeneration of Carosat 1 stereo data. After submission of M.Sc dissertation thesis, I worked with a NGO <a href="http://www.atindia.org/">Appropriate Technology India (AT India)</a> as GIS expert for DRR and watershed analysis in the Central Himalayan Region of Uttarakhand. As a young environmentalist, I became hooked on the endless and diverse ways in which space-based information can contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, climate and environment. This subject continues to inspire me to this day.</p>
